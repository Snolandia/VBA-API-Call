# VBA-API-Call
A VBA api call and json parser. Built specifically to access Epicor's Rest API, the api call should work on any Epicor baq, but the Parser has not been tested against anything except Epicor results. Requires Microsoft XML as a reference

*note, can be made to work for epicor non baq api calls, but may require some massaging per Business Object as each call is unique.
